    On a lazy spring afternoon, Conor and Jack were talking on the phone. Conor was the businessman, Jack the tech geek,
    both always thinking of new business ideas that integrated their skills. Out of nowhere, Conor mentioned a dog-walking company. Both were guys born and raised
    in Dorchester, the tight-knit Irish-Catholic community in Boston. After some deliberation, it seemed nothing could be better than
    using their knowledge and connections in the neighborhood and around Boston to spawn a business with very little overhead and
    lots of networking involved. DotWalkers was born.

    We aim to provide perfect service on a flexible schedule for anybody who either doesn't have the time or the
    energy to walk their dog, a crucially important activity for the development and healthy maintenance of
    any canine. Please allow us to ease your minds and your schedules by providing top-notch service at great prices!
